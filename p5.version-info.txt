The Live Ontologies Project team is pleased to announce 
        the Protege Proof Justification Explanation 0.0.1 release!

This is a plug-in that provides the Protege Justification Explanation plug-in with
proof-based justifications by registering as an extension to its justification service.
It defines an extension point to obtain a prover also since it does not compute proofs
by its own but uses the chosen prover instead. The main functionality of this plug-in 
is computing justifications based on proof and providing the Protege Justification
Explanation plug-in with them.
